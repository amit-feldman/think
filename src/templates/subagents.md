# Subagent Automation

Rules for when Claude should automatically spawn subagents.

## Before Implementation
- Spawn Explore agent to understand existing codebase patterns before making changes

## After Code Changes
- Spawn code-reviewer agent before creating commits

## Research Tasks
- When 3+ files need investigation, use parallel Explore agents

## Before Completion
- Spawn verification agent before claiming work is done
